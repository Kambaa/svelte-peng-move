# `peng-move`

This is the companion app to my Svelte Summit Spring talk "Svelte in Motion".

If you wish to follow along with the talk, then use the [`start` branch](https://github.com/pngwn/peng-move/tree/start).

If you wish to see teh changes you can step through the commits in [this PR](https://github.com/pngwn/peng-move/pull/1).

The 'finished' app is on `main`. You can try it out live here (it only really works on mobile or in responsive mode, try it on your phone): https://peng-move.vercel.app/
